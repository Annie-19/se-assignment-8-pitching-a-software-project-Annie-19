 Questions:

1. Understanding the Audience:
   - Why is it important to understand your audience when pitching a software project? How can you tailor your pitch to different types of stakeholders (e.g., investors, technical team, customers)?

Understanding your audience when pitching a software project is important for several reasons:
1.Tailored Communication:
-Your pitch deck (a visual presentation for investors) should be tailored to the specific needs and interests of your target audience.

-Investors and decision-makers need a compelling problem statement to understand the project’s purpose and potential impact.
3.Crafting an Effective Problem Statement:
-Start with a solid foundation of data to inform your statement.
-A robust problem statement should include:
-Current State: Describe the present situation using measurable indicators (e.g., quality, cost, time).
-Future State: Contrast the current state with the envisioned future (measurable targets derived from customer needs or strategic objectives).
-Target Date: Set a specific date for achieving the future state, creating urgency and accountability

HOW TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE THE PROBLEM THAT YOUR SOFTWARE AIMS TO SOLVE
